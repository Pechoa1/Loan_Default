# Loan_Default

This project was done during my undergraduate degree. It's goal was to predict loan default from a kaggle data set. It was completed with assistance form my statistics professor, in my free time. 

The project required data preparation along with implementing logistic regression to predict default. Our findings were missing data was the cause of default. Once this was discovered a dashboard was build to present the findings.
